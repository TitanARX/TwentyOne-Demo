# TwentyOne-Demo
 Demo of upcoming tile 21 Rush. 21 ush is retro 80's/tetris influenced math game where player must arrange numbers to make the number 21 in order to score. The game features  wildcard cubes which can clear columns or rowns or both. Start from the Main Menu Scene. This project is currently in development for the Xbox and PC. It features all original music and is currently on track for a Winter release. 
 
 NOTE:
 
 There is a known bug where if too many solves take place in multiple directions, some of the cubes positions do not update. This is being worked out.
